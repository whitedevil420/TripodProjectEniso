# TripodProjectEniso Arduino Code

during this project we are maneuvering the camera mount residing on the top of our tripod by two Servo motors with perpendicular axis.
To achieve this we used an XY Dual Axis Joystick Module and arduino card and we mapped the output of the joystick to an angular speed.
clicking the button will center the camera mount thus the camera.
